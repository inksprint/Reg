                            <li><strong>Hallucination:</strong> Inventing false information when correct data is unavailable</li>
                            <li><strong>Static Knowledge:</strong> Inability to learn new information after training</li>
                            <li><strong>No Source Verification:</strong> Unable to cite sources for provided information</li>
                            <li><strong>Outdated Information:</strong> Lack of knowledge about recent events or current data</li>
                            <li><strong>Context Window Limits:</strong> Restricted memory for long conversations or documents</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Example:</strong> If you ask about your company's latest policies, the LLM cannot provide accurate answers as it only has pre-training knowledge.</p>
